# Create your own image classifier
## AI Programming with Python Project2

This project involves training an image classifier that can identify various species of flowers. The classifier could potentially be utilized in a mobile app that provides users with the name of the flower their camera is capturing. Once the classifier is trained, it can be exported for use in the application. The dataset utilized in this project consists of 102 distinct flower categories.
